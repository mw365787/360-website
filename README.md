# 360-website
An 90% completed static website for a client using ReactJS library.
Very challenging project which built fundamental understanding of this
powerful framework. It is responsive on mobile and tablet versions but not on desktop
Unfortunately, due to customer's non-decisiveness I had to abandon the project.
Nonetheless, it was very engaging and I have learned a lot from it both programming-wise
as well as interacting with customer.
Moreover, I have gone through the deployment process of the web app first time in my life.
