# 360-website
An 90% completed static website for a client using ReactJS library.
Very challenging project which built fundamental understanding of this
powerful framework.
Unfortunately, due to customer's non-decisiveness I had to abandon the project.
Nonetheless, it was very engaging and I have learned a lot from it both programming-wise
as well as interacting with customer.
